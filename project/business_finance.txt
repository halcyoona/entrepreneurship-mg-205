When you start a business and apply for a startup loan, you may be asked for several specific startup financial statements, including income statement, and a balance sheet. Creating these financial statements may seem pointless because you don't have an ongoing business at this point. What profits? What assets?

The balance sheet is an important document that does give information to a lender.

They are looking for some specific information to use in consideration for a startup loan. For a business startup without a history, the balance sheet shows the financial position of the business as of the startup date, including what has actually happened at the current stage of startup and what will happen before the date the business starts.

A balance sheet is a business statement that shows what the business owns, what it owes, and the value of the owner's investment in the business. The balance sheet is calculated at a specific point in time - at business startup; at the end of a month, a quarter, or a year depending upon the accounting period.

A balance sheet is shown in two columns, with assets on the left and liabilities and owner's equity on the right. The total assets must equal total liabilities + total owners equity; that is, the totals must balance. This is called the accounting formula.


An analysis of this balance sheet shows that the owner has contributed $12,500 in equity (mostly in cash and furniture/fixtures) to the startup of the business.

Offsetting the assets are the liabilities and owner's equity. The current liabilities totally $1,000 are probably some debts owed to vendors for some of the office furniture.
