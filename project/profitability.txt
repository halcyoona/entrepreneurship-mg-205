Profit works as a signal to the entrepreneur in several ways. Most entrepreneurs start businesses to solve problems, offer alternatives to consumers or satisfy needs that are not being met. They develop business plans around their ideas and then implement them. Profits serve as a barometer for how entrepreneurs market and promote their wares and services. These individuals expand on ideas if they are successful or change marketing strategies if profits fall short of their projections.


An income statement (also called a profit-and-loss statement) shows the profitability of a business over a specific period of time. It is one of the fundamental documents that make up a companyâ€™s financial reporting.


From income statement this is clear our business is not producing enough profit in first two months but we are ready for that because our break-even time period is six month.After six month we rethink about business take valuable actions.
